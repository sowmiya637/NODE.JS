## ## ⭐ What Are Events in Node.js?

Node.js is built on an **event-driven architecture**, meaning the system reacts to events (like clicks, data received, timers, file read completion, etc.).
This makes Node.js **asynchronous**, **non-blocking**, and **high-performance**.

---

## ## ⭐ Event Loop

The **Event Loop** is the heart of Node.js.
It continuously waits for events and executes the associated callbacks.
This allows Node.js to handle multiple tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread.

# # 🔥 EventEmitter — Main Concepts

## ## ✔ EventEmitter

`EventEmitter` is a class from Node.js’s `events` module.
It allows you to:

* Create custom events
* Listen to events
* Trigger (emit) events
* Remove event listeners
* Pass data during events

Almost everything in Node.js internally uses EventEmitter (streams, HTTP, sockets, timers, etc.).

---

## ## ✔ event.on(eventName, listener)

Registers a **listener** for a specific event.
The listener is executed **every time** that event is emitted.

---

## ## ✔ event.emit(eventName, ...args)

Triggers (emits) an event.
When emitted:

* All listeners registered for that event are executed in order
* You can pass extra arguments to listeners

---

## ## ✔ event.once(eventName, listener)

Registers a listener that runs **only one time**.
After executing once, the listener is automatically removed.

Useful for:

* Initial setup
* First-time login event
* One-time app start message

---

## ## ✔ Multiple Listeners for a Single Event

A single event can have **multiple listeners**, and all of them will run when the event is emitted.
They execute in registration order.

---

## ## ✔ Passing Arguments with Events

Events can carry **additional data**.
These arguments are sent to the listener function.

Example real uses:

* Order details in an e-commerce system
* User login data
* Notifications
* API response info

---

## ## ✔ event.removeListener(eventName, listener)

Removes a specific listener from an event.
Useful when you want to stop a function from running on future emits.

---

## ## ✔ event.removeAllListeners(eventName)

Removes **all listeners** associated with an event.
Used for cleanup or avoiding memory leaks.

---

# # ⭐ Importance of EventEmitter

EventEmitter makes Node.js:

* **Asynchronous**
* **Efficient**
* **Scalable**
* **Non-blocking**
* Ideal for event-heavy applications

Most core modules in Node.js internally use EventEmitter.
